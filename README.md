# Insulator for iPhone

## Description
Insulator is a fast, efficient way for Type 1 Diabetics to calculate the amount of insulin needed to bring their blood sugar to a healthy level. It's the best insulin calculator for iPhone.

Insulator uses standard formulas sanctioned by the [NHS](www.nhs.uk) and [DAFNE](http://www.dafne.uk.com), including the insulin-to-carb ratio, the 500 rule and the 100 rule. It supports both mmol/L & mg/dL so diabetics all over the world can enjoy simplified insulin calculations.

The interface is designed to be clean, focused, simple-to-understand and easy-to-use, whilst adhering to the Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

Insulator is made with passion by a diabetic, for diabetics. Give Insulator a try and see if it can make your life as a diabetic a little bit easier!

_(Insulator should only be used as a guideline. Seek guidance from a doctor if you are unsure about using the application.)_

## Change Log
### 1.0.0
#### Beta 5
Many of you pointed out issues in the 'onboarding experience'. This wasn't ready for primetime and wasn't supposed to be visible! It has been removed.

Fixed a lot of Auto Layout issues, which should result in less UI weirdness. If you encounter any UI oddities during your testing, please let me know (along with the device you're using and Text Size setting).

If you have denied Insulator access to Health, pressing 'Get Health Data' will now display an alert explaining the situation.

Tapping on cells with text entry fields now sets focus on those fields. If the field already contains a value, tapping the cell will select all text in the field.

The 'Carbohydrate Decimal Place' preference has been renamed to 'Carbohdyrate Accuracy', and now works correctly.

#### Beta 4
Added in-app settings. This screen features three sections: Preferences, Feedback and Tip Jar. The feedback section has three rows: Email, Twitter and App Store. Please test these (the App Store button should open App Store and load Pinner for Pinboard). While you won't be able to make any in-app purchases, the prices should load in correctly.

#### Beta 3
Added Dynamic Type support.
#### Beta 2
Tightened up the user interface, which should now render correctly on all screen sizes. Added a Done button in the Navigation Bar which will dismiss the keyboard.

#### Beta 1
Basic functionality is available but the complete feature set has not been implemented yet. The user interface is rough and lacking polish.
